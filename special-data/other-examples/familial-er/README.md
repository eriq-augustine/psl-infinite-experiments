### Familial Entity Resolution

## Problem

In this example, we attempt to construct unified family trees from many noisy ego-centric family trees.

## Dataset

The dataset originally came from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
It contains information from 497 interviews over 162 families.
Each interview yielded an ego-centric family tree,
that is a family tree from the interviewee's perspective.

## Origin

This example is a simplified version of the NIH experiment from Kouki et al.'s paper:
"Collective Entity Resolution in Familial Networks":
```
@conference {kouki:icdm17,
	title = {Collective Entity Resolution in Familial Networks},
	booktitle = {IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)},
	year = {2017},
	note = {To Appear},
	url = {https://github.com/pkouki/icdm2017},
	author = {Kouki, Pigi and Pujara, Jay and Marcum, Christopher and Koehly, Laura and Lise Getoor}
}
```
